I'm a software engineer currently based in Atlanta.

I created this website using Jekyll. They provide a theme which makes it easy to manage a blogging style site.
You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

I bought the imonimccorvey domain on [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host and deploy the site.
